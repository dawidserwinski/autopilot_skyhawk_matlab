# High-maneuvering aircraft automatic control system - Matlab/Simulink
## 1 Autopilot Flight Control System Project
The project concerns the control system of a highly maneuverable aircraft. 
The design takes into account the coupling of the lateral and longitudinal motion of the aircraft. 
A non-linear aircraft model has been created. To compensate for the loss of altitude, a control system for the drive unit was used. 
Feedback from the roll angle was used for this purpose.
